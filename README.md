Step Counter using MicroBit 
=====================

This is a small sample project which incorporates a walking steps counter using accelerometer sensor built inside microbit. 

Features a pixel based simpler UI to show progress instead of showing count in scrolling text.

#ToDo:

- [ ] ​	Stabilise the working of Accelerometer sensor. 
- [ ] ​	Enable BLE option to transmit data  and also set goals from smart phone.
